# README
This script is used to run memaslap, a memcached benchmarking tool, with customizable options.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, make sure that you have the following:
- memcached service is installed and running
- memaslap is installed on your system
- bash is installed on your system

## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the script using the following command: `bash driver_local run memcached [options]`.


## Options
This script accepts a number of options to customize the behavior of memaslap. Here are the available options:
- `-s, --servers` : Sets the server address.
- `-T, --threads` : Sets the number of threads to use.
- `-c, --concurrency` : Sets the number of concurrent connections to make.
- `-n, --conn_sock` : Sets the connection socket.
- `-x, --execute_number` : Sets the number of operations to execute.
- `-t, --time` : Sets the time limit in seconds for the benchmark.
- `-F, --cfg_cmd` : Sets the configuration command to run.
- `-w, --win_size` : Sets the window size.
- `-X, --fixed_size` : Sets the fixed size.
- `-v, --verify` : Sets the verification mode.
- `-d, --division` : Sets the division factor.
- `-S, --stat_freq` : Sets the frequency for displaying statistics.
- `-e, --exp_verify` : Sets the expected verification mode.
- `-o, --overwrite` : Sets the overwrite mode.
- `-P, --tps` : Sets the target TPS (transactions per second).
- `-p, --rep_write` : Sets the repetition factor for writes.
- `-R, --reconnect` : Enables the reconnect mode.
- `-U, --udp` : Enables the UDP mode.
- `-a, --facebook` : Enables the Facebook mode.
- `-B, --binary` : Enables the binary protocol.
- `-b, --verbose` : Enables verbose output.
- `-h, --help` : Displays the help message.
- `-V, --version` : Displays the version information.

Note that not all options are required, and some may have default values. For more information on each option, refer to the script's code.

## Output
When memaslap is executed, the output will be displayed in the terminal window. Additionally, two output files will be generated in the evaluation directory: output_memcached_time_<timestamp>.txt and output_memcached_<timestamp>.txt. These files contain the benchmarking results and the time taken for the benchmark, respectively.

## Troubleshooting
If the script does not run, try the following:
- Ensure that memcached service is installed and running.
- Ensure that memaslap is installed on your system.
- Ensure that the script file has execute permission.

If the benchmark results are unexpected, try the following:
- Adjust the options to better match your desired use case.
- Check the logs generated by memcached to ensure that there are no issues with the server.
