terminated by either party, acting in its discretion, giving five (5) calendar days' notice to the
other party.

11. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
11.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the
subject matter of this Agreement. For clarification, Developer has no rights under any other
agreements or terms offered by Licensor unless and until the parties enter into a separate
agreement embodying such terms. Terms set forth in any Developer's document that are in
addition to or at variance with the terms of this Agreement are specifically waived by Developer.
All such terms are considered to be proposed material alterations of this Agreement and are
hereby rejected. No waiver, consent or modification of this Agreement shall bind either party
unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought, except the terms
of this Agreement may be modified by Licensor from time to time so long as they do not result
in a diminution of the rights granted hereunder. The most recent revision of this Agreement will
be posted on http://voltdb.com/developer-edition-license-agreement. The failure of either party
to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a
waiver of such rights. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or
unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This
Agreement is in English only, which shall be controlling in all respects. No version of this
Agreement in another language shall be binding or of any effect.
11.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflicts of law
provisions. In the event of any conflict between US and foreign laws, rules and regulations, U.S.
laws, rules and regulations shall govern. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.
11.3 Remedies. Unless specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement
is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Developer agrees that, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach of Sections 2.1, 5 or 6, Licensor will suffer irreparable
damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled to
injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach,
without the necessity of posting any bond.
11.4 Notices. Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally
delivered, or sent via confirmed electronic mail, or sent via recognized express delivery courier
or certified or registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party
at its address specified above, or at such other address designated in a subsequent notice. All
notices shall be in English, effective upon receipt.
11.5 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder are personal to
Developer, and may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, without
Licensor's prior written consent. Any attempt to do otherwise shall be void and of no effect.
Without Developer's consent, Licensor may assign this Agreement to any third party. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and
permitted assigns of the parties.
11.6 Government License. If any user of the Software or Documentation is a department,
agency or other entity of the US Government, then use, duplication, reproduction, modification,
release, disclosure or transfer of the Software and Documentation is restricted in accordance with
FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFAR 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software is
commercial computer software and the Documentation is commercial computer software
documentation, and their use is further restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
11.7 Acknowledgment. Developer acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands this
Agreement, (b) it has had an opportunity to have its legal counsel review this Agreement, (c) this
Agreement has the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (d) Licensor requires
identification of the Developer before issuing this License, and (e) issuance of this License does
not constitute general publication of the Software, Documentation or Confidential Information.
