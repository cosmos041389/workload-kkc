What's here
===========

This directory tree, tests/test_apps/voter, was cloned
from examples/voter on 2021-12-10.

The intent is to avoid burdening example code with features
that internal voltdb testing would like to use. The examples
should remain reasonably simple examples.

Everything is executed via 'run.sh'.  You must set your
working directory to this directory, tests/test_apps/voter.

'./run.sh help' will list available test targets.
