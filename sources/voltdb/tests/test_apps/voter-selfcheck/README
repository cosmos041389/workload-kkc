Voter selftest application
==========================

This application is used for internal VoltDB testing.
It is invoked by several scripts in the pro repo, under
tests/apptests/voter.

It has its own copy of source code, separate from that
in test_apps/voter. Too many tests break if we try to
combine them.  There are some source-code differences:

- Rejected (too many) votes are counted and returned by the Vote procedure.
  This is useful for testing replication - since the hash of the replication
  result will be checked against the hash of the original result.  Differences
  will cause replication failure.

- The local ddl.sql specifically sets up the tables needed for that
  version of Vote.

- The return type of the Vote procedure is different; this one returns
  VoltTable[] instead of long, so they're not interchangeable.

- There is an HTTPBenchmark, possibly unused, that has not been integrated
  into test_apps/voter yet. Note it seems to be tied to the specific
  return type of VoltTable[].

- The compiled code lives in a single voter.jar, unlike the usual case with
  separate voter-client.jar and voter-proc.jar files. This is assumed to be
  necessary for existing test scripts,
